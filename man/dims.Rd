\value{
a single integer value or, for \code{dim}, a length-3 integer vector,
e.g. \code{c(2000, 30, 3)} for an \code{NMF} model that fits a 2000 x 30
matrix using 3 basis components.
}
\description{
The methods \code{dim}, \code{nrow}, \code{ncol} and \code{nbasis} return
the different dimensions associated with an NMF model.

\code{dim} returns all dimensions in a length-3 integer vector:
the number of row and columns of the estimated target matrix,
as well as the factorization rank (i.e. the number of basis components).

\code{nrow}, \code{ncol} and \code{nbasis} provide separate access to each
of these dimensions respectively.

method for NMF objects for the base generic \code{\link{dim}}.
It returns all dimensions in a length-3 integer vector:
the number of row and columns of the estimated target matrix,
as well as the factorization rank (i.e. the number of basis components).

Since all fits have the same dimensions, it returns the dimension of the 
first fit.
This method returns \code{NULL} if the object is empty.
}
\details{
The NMF package does not implement specific functions \code{nrow} and \code{ncol},
but rather the S4 method \code{dim} for objects of class \code{\linkS4class{NMF}}.
This allows the base methods \code{\link{nrow}} and \code{\link{ncol}} to
directly work with such objects, to get the number of rows and columns of
the target matrix estimated by an NMF model.

The function \code{nbasis} is a new S4 generic defined in the package NMF, that
returns the number of basis components of an object.
Its default method should work for any object, that has a suitable
\code{basis} method defined for its class.
