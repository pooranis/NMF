\title{Interface for Single Function NMF Strategies}
\description{
This class implements the virtual interface \code{\link{NMFStrategy}} for 
NMF algorithms that are implemented by a single workhorse R function.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{algorithm}}{a function that implements an NMF algorithm.
It must have signature \code{(y='matrix', x='NMFfit')}, where \code{y} is the 
target matrix to approximate and \code{x} is the NMF model assumed to be  
seeded with an appropriate initial value -- as it is done internally by 
function \code{\link{nmf}}.

Note that argument names currently do not matter, but it is recommended to 
name them as specified above.}
