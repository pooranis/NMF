\title{S4 Interface for Octave-Matlab NMF Algorithms}
\usage{
\S4method{show}{NMFStrategyOctave}(object)
}
\description{
This class implements the virtual interface \code{\linkS4class{NMFStrategy}} 
for NMF algorithms that are implemented in Octave/Matlab, and provided as
a set of .m files or as plain code.
}
\details{
The \code{run} method for this class runs the algorithms via the 
\code{\link[RcppOctave]{RcppOctave}} package.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{algorithm}}{character string that gives the name of the main Octave/Matlab 
function that implements the algorithm.
The function must take at least two arguments: the target matrix and the initial 
NMF model, converted into an Octave list object, with elements corresponding to 
slots of the corresponding S4 class.}

\item{\code{mcode}}{character vector that contains a set of path to .m files.
These files are (re-)sourced every time the strategy is called, and must be 
present at runtime in the current directory or in a directory from Octave path.}
}}
