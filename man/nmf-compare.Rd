\usage{
\S4method{compare}{NMFfit}(object, ...)

\S4method{compare}{list}(object, ...)

\S4method{summary}{NMFList}(object, sort.by = NULL, select = NULL, ...)

\S4method{plot}{NMFList,missing}(x, y, skip = -1L, ...)

\S4method{consensusmap}{NMF.rank}(object, ...)

\S4method{consensusmap}{list}(object, layout, Rowv = FALSE,
  main = names(object), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{extra arguments passed by \code{compare} to \code{summary,NMFList}
or to the \code{summary} method of each fit.}

\item{sort.by}{the sorting criteria, i.e. a partial match of a column name,
by which the result \code{data.frame} is sorted.  The sorting direction
(increasing or decreasing) is computed internally depending on the chosen
criteria (e.g. decreasing for the cophenetic coefficient, increasing for the
residuals).}

\item{select}{the columns to be output in the result \code{data.frame}.  The
column are given by their names (partially matched).  The column names are
the names of the summary measures returned by the \code{summary} methods of
the corresponding NMF results.}

\item{x}{an \code{NMFList} object that contains fits from separate NMF runs.}

\item{y}{missing}

\item{skip}{an integer that indicates the number of points to skip/remove from the beginning
of the curve.
If \code{skip=1L} (default) only the initial residual -- that is computed before any iteration, is
skipped, if present in the track (it associated with iteration 0).}

\item{layout}{specification of the layout.
It may be a single numeric or a numeric couple, to indicate a square or rectangular layout 
respectively, that is filled row by row.
It may also be a matrix that is directly passed to the function \code{\link[graphics]{layout}}
from the package \code{graphics}.}
}
\description{
The functions documented here allow to compare the fits computed in 
different NMF runs.
The fits do not need to be from the same algorithm, nor have the same
dimension.

Compare multiple NMF fits passed as arguments.

Compares multiple NMF fits passed as a standard list.

Draw a single plot with a heatmap of the consensus matrix obtained for each value of the rank, 
in the range tested with \code{\link{nmfEstimateRank}}.

Draw a single plot with a heatmap of the consensus matrix of each element in the list \code{object}.

\details{
The methods \code{compare} enables to compare multiple NMF fits either 
passed as arguments or as a list of fits.
These methods eventually call the method \code{summary,NMFList}, so that
all its arguments can be passed \strong{named} in \code{...}.

\code{summary,NMFList} computes summary measures for each NMF result in the list 
and return them in rows in a \code{data.frame}. 
By default all the measures are included in the result, and \code{NA} values 
are used where no data is available or the measure does not apply to the 
result object (e.g. the dispersion for single' NMF runs is not meaningful). 
This method is very useful to compare and evaluate the performance of 
different algorithms.

\code{plot} plot on a single graph the residuals tracks for each fit in \code{x}. 
See function \code{\link{nmf}} for details on how to enable the tracking of residuals.

x <- rmatrix(20,10)
res <- nmf(x, 3)
res2 <- nmf(x, 2, 'lee')

# compare arguments
compare(res, res2, target=x)

# compare elements of a list
compare(list(res, res2), target=x)
